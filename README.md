Keepchat
========

A mod for Snapchat for Android, built using the Xposed Framework

Features
--------
- Hooks into the Snapchat application; just install and go
- Saves both images and videos
- Toast popups to notify you of success
- Open Source
- Free!

Installation
------------
1. Install Xposed Framework
2. Install Keepchat
3. Enable Keepchat in Xposed
4. Reboot Phone
5. Use Snapchat as normal
6. Find your saved Snaps in /sdcard/keepchat/

### IMPORTANT NOTE: While Keepchat is enabled, all Snaps you view will be marked as SCREENSHOTTED! I figured it was only fair to the people sending you Snaps. If you want to compile your own without this "feature," it's a one-line change in the source.
